However, there are well-behaved versions of these operations, called the natural sums and natural products. In this post, I'll unravel the definitions of natural sums and explore their connection to the usual ordinal sum. I'll also discuss their order-theoretic interpretations. As usual, all references to papers and books will be listed at the bottom of this post. Let's dive in! </p> <p align="justify"> As a refresher, let's first look at the usual ordinal addition and multiplication. Recall that if $\alpha&gt;0$ is an ordinal, then $\alpha = \{\gamma : \gamma&lt;\alpha \text{ and } \gamma \text{ is an ordinal}\}$. Now, for ordinals $\alpha$ and $\beta$, we have the following definition for $\alpha + \beta $. </p> <p> <strong>Definition 1</strong>: $\alpha + \beta = type\big((\{0\}\times\alpha)\cup (\{1\}\times\beta),&lt;_{\alpha + \beta}\big)$, where $&lt;_{\alpha+\beta}$ is the lexicographical ordering induced by the usual ordering $&lt;$. </p> <p align="justify"> Let's look at an example; \(3+5=8\) as we have \[(0,0) &lt;_{3+5} (0,1) &lt;_{3+5} (0,2) &lt;_{3+5} (1,0) &lt;_{3+5} (1,1) &lt;_{3+5} (1,2) &lt;_{3+5} (1,3) &lt;_{3+5} (1,4).\] Note that we used the fact that \(3=\{0,1,2\}\) and \(5=\{0,1,2,3,4\}\) here. From now on, I'll use \(&lt;\) to represent the lexicographical ordering, as the context should make it clear. </p> <p align="justify"> Recall that $\omega = type\big((\mathbb{N},&lt;)\big)$. So for example, the order type of $1+\omega$ is \[type\big((0,0)&lt;(1,0)&lt;(1,1)&lt;(1,2)&lt;\cdots\big) = \omega.\] So we have $1+\omega = \omega$. On the other hand $\omega+1 \neq \omega$ because what we get is \[(0,0)&lt;(0,1)&lt;(0,2)&lt;\cdots&lt;(1,0).\] This shows that the usual ordinal additional is not commutative. </p> <p align="justify"> Okay! I hope the definition is clear now. As most things in math, we can also define the usual addition using induction, or, more precisely, transfinite recursion. I will not discuss the principle of transfinite recursion here. Let's leave it for another post. Without any further ado: </p> <p> <strong>Definition 2</strong>: Let $\alpha$ and $\beta$ be ordinals. <ol> <li>$\alpha+0=\alpha$.</li> <li>$\alpha + (\beta +1) = (\alpha + \beta) +1$.</li> <li>For a limit ordinal $\gamma$, $\alpha+\gamma = \sup \{\alpha +\beta : \beta&lt;\gamma\}$.</li> </ol> </p> <p align="justify"> Of course, $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are ordinals in the above definition. Now, even though the usual addition didn't turn out to be commutative, it is indeed associative. We can easily show using the inductive definition that for all ordinals $\alpha,\beta,$ and $\gamma$, $(\alpha +\beta)+\gamma = \alpha + (\beta+\gamma)$. The induction argument happens in three steps; first, show for $0$, second, show for successors $\delta+1$ assuming the result is true for $\delta$, and thirdly and finally, show it's true for limits $\gamma$ assuming it's true for all $\delta&lt;\gamma$. Of course, one may prove it using the first definition as well. </p> <p align="justify"> Now it's time to look at the definition of product. Let $\alpha$ and $\beta$ be two ordinals. Then: </p> <p> <strong>Definition 3</strong>: $\alpha\cdot\beta$, that is the ordinal product of $\alpha$ and $\beta$, is $type\big(\beta\times \alpha,&lt;_{\beta\times\alpha})\big)$, where $&lt;_{\beta\times\alpha}$ is the lexicographical ordering on $\beta\times\alpha$. Here $\beta\times\alpha$ is the Cartesian product of $\beta$ and $\alpha$. </p> <p align="justify"> Let's look at some examples. Again I'll omit the subscript on the lexicographical ordering. We know $3\cdot 4 = 12$. This is because \[(0,0)&lt;(0,1)&lt;(0,2)&lt;(1,0)&lt;(1,1)&lt;(1,2)&lt;(2,0)&lt;(2,1)&lt;(2,2)&lt;(3,0)&lt;(3,1)&lt;(3,2).\] In the same way, $\omega\cdot 2 = \omega +\omega$ and $2\cdot \omega = \omega$. We can view these two examples as two copies of omega, and omega copies of two, respectively. And this tells us that the usual multiplication of ordinals is not commutative. </p> <p align="justify"> The following result let's us define the usual ordinal multiplication inductively. Let $\alpha,\beta$ and $\gamma$ be ordinals. Then: </p> <p> <strong>Fact</strong>: $\alpha \cdot (\beta +\gamma) = (\alpha \cdot \beta) + (\alpha \cdot \gamma)$. </p> <p> <strong>Warning</strong>: However $(\alpha +\beta)\cdot \gamma = (\alpha \cdot \gamma) + (\beta \cdot \gamma)$ does not hold in general. Because \[(1+\omega)\cdot\omega = \omega\cdot\omega \neq \omega + \omega\cdot\omega = 1\cdot\omega +\omega\cdot\omega.\] </p> <p align="justify"> Now multiplication is defined inductively as follows. Let $\alpha,\beta$, and $\gamma$ be ordinals. </p> <p> <strong>Definition 4</strong>: Let $\alpha$ and $\beta$ be ordinals. <ol> <li>$\alpha\cdot 0 = 0$.</li> <li>$\alpha \cdot (\beta +1) =\alpha\cdot \beta +\alpha$.</li> <li> $\alpha \cdot \gamma = \sup \{\alpha\cdot \beta : \beta&lt;\gamma\}$ for limit ordinals $\gamma$.</li> </ol> </p> <p align="justify"> We will now look at something called the Cantor Normal Form of an ordinal number, that is: </p> <p> <strong>Theorem (Cantor Normal Form)</strong>: Any ordinal number $\alpha &gt; 0$ can be written uniquely as $ \alpha = \omega^{\alpha_n} \cdot k_n + \cdots + \omega^{\alpha_0} \cdot k_0, $ where $n, k_0, \ldots, k_n \in {\mathbb{N}}^&gt;$, and $\alpha \geq \alpha_n &gt; \cdots &gt; \alpha_0$ is a finite sequence of ordinals. </p> <p align="justify"> Since for any ordinal $\alpha$ and $k \in \mathbb{N}^&gt;$, we have that $\omega^{\alpha} \cdot k$ equals $\omega^{\alpha}$ added to itself $k$-times, we can express the right-hand side of the equation in Cantor normal form as follows: $ \omega^{\alpha_n} + \cdots+ \omega^{\alpha_1} + \omega^{\alpha_0} $ for suitable $n \in \mathbb{N}^&gt;$ and ordinals $\alpha_n\geq\cdots \geq \alpha_1 \geq \alpha_0$. </p> <p align="justify"> We are now ready to define the Hessenberg sum of two ordinals $\alpha$ and $\beta$. First, we write $\alpha,\beta$ in their Cantor Normal form. Say $$\alpha = \omega^{\alpha_n} \cdot r_n + \cdots + \omega^{\alpha_0} \cdot r_0$$ and $$\beta=\omega^{\beta_m}\cdot s_m+\cdots+\omega^{\beta_0}\cdot s_0,$$ where $n,m, r_1, \ldots, r_n,s_1,\ldots,s_m \in {\mathbb{N}}^&gt;$, and $\alpha \geq \alpha_1 &gt; \cdots &gt; \alpha_n$, $\beta\geq \beta_1&gt;\cdots \beta_m$ are ordinals. Then set $\gamma_k=\max(\alpha_n,\beta_m)$, where $k=\max(n,m)$. So we get, by introducing null-coefficients if we want, $$\alpha=\omega^{\gamma_k}\cdot u_k+\cdots+\omega^{\gamma_1}\cdot u_1+\omega^+\omega^{\gamma_0}\cdot u_0,$$ and $$\beta=\omega^{\gamma_k}\cdot v_k+\cdots+\omega^{\gamma_1}\cdot v_1+\omega^{\gamma_0}\cdot v_0,$$ where $k,u_k,\ldots,u_1,u_0,v_k,\ldots,v_1,v_0\in \mathbb{N}$ and $\gamma_k&gt;\cdots&gt;\gamma_1&gt;\gamma_0$ are ordinals. We are now ready to define the Hessenberg sum of $\alpha$ and $\beta$. Let's denote it by $\alpha~{\#}~\beta$. Then: </p> <p> <strong>Definition (Hessenberg Sum)</strong>: \[ \alpha~\#~\beta=\omega^{\gamma_k}\cdot(u_k+v_k)+\cdots+\omega^{\gamma_1}\cdot(u_1+v_1)+\omega^{\gamma_0}\cdot (u_0+v_0).\] </p> <p align="justify"> Alright. Now let's look at a general notion of natural sums. According to Carruth <a href="#carruth1942arithmetic">[1]</a>, a binary operation $\oplus$ is a <strong>natural sum</strong> on the class of ordinals, if for all ordinals $\alpha,\beta$ and $\delta$ we have: <ol> <li>$\alpha\oplus \beta =\beta \oplus \alpha$.</li> <li>$(\alpha \oplus \beta)\oplus\delta = \alpha \oplus (\beta\oplus \delta)$.</li> <li> $\alpha \oplus 0=\alpha$.</li> <li>$\delta\oplus \alpha &gt;\delta\oplus \beta$ if and only if $\alpha&gt;\beta$.</li> </ol> </p> <p align="justify"> Note that by property (1) and (4), we get $\alpha \oplus \delta &gt;\beta\oplus \delta$ if and only if $\alpha&gt;\beta$. So these properties capture the idea of a ``natural" sum nicely; hence the name Natural Sum. </p> <p align="justify"> Now we define something called the ``mixed sum" also known as ``shuffled sum." We follow Lipparini's paper <a href="#lipparini2018some">[2]</a>. Let $\alpha,\beta$ and $\delta$ be ordinals as before. We say $\delta$ is the mixed sum of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ if: <ol> <li>There are disjoint $A,B\subseteq \delta$ such that $\delta =A\cup B$, and</li> <li> $type_{\delta}(A)=\alpha$ and $type_{\delta}(B)=\beta$.</li> </ol> </p> <p align="justify"> For instance, $type_\delta(A)$ means the order type of $A$ inherited by $\delta$. Note that if $A$ and $B$ are not disjoint, we can always take their join $A+B := (A\times\{0\}) \cup (B\times \{1\})$. Carruth <a href="#carruth1942arithmetic">[1]</a> proves the following: <ol> <li> $type_{\delta}(A + B)\leq \alpha\oplus \beta$.</li> <li> $type_{\delta}(A + B)=\alpha~\#~\beta$.</li> <li>$\alpha~\#~\beta\leq \alpha\oplus \beta$.</li> <li>$\alpha +\beta \leq \alpha \oplus \beta$.</li> </ol> </p> <p align="justify"> From Carruth's theorem we get: </p> <p> <strong>Theorem (Carruth)</strong>: For any two ordinals $\alpha$ and $\beta$, the largest mixed sum of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ exists and equals $\alpha~\#~\beta$. </p> <p align="justify"> I'll end this post with the following example. We saw under usual ordinal addition that $1+\omega=\omega\neq \omega+1$. However, we have $1~\#~\omega=\omega~\#~1$. This is clear by definition of $\#$; remember the polynomial-like addition. On the other hand, if we write $A=\{0\}\times 1$ and $B=\{1\}\times\omega$, then the order type of the largest mixed sum of $1$ and $\omega$ is $\omega+1$, so $1~\#~\omega=\omega~\#~1$. </p> <h2>References</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li><span id="ccarruth1942arithmetic">Carruth, Philip W., 1942.

This is the first part of a series of posts on a problem of Skolem's (Yes, the mathematician and logician Thoralf Skolem!). In this post, I will introduce the problem and work through a minimal example. I will list all the books and papers at the bottom of each post. I will use $\mathbb{N}$ and $\mathbb{N}^&gt;$ to denote the set of natural numbers and the set of non-zero natural numbers respectively. </p> <p align="justify"> Consider the set $\mathcal{S}$ of functions $f:\mathbb{N}\to \mathbb{N}$ which contains the constant function $\mathbf{1}$ and the identity function $\mathbf{x}$ and which is closed under addition, multiplication, and exponentiation. That is, </p> <ol> <li>$\mathbf{1} \in \mathcal{S}$</li> <li>$\mathbf{x} \in \mathcal{S}$</li> <li>If $f$ and $g$ are in $\mathcal{S}$ then so are $f+g$, $fg$, and $f^g$.</li> </ol> <p align="justify"> For example, the set of all non-zero polynomials are in $\mathcal{S}$, and so are the functions $\mathbf{x}^{\mathbf{x}^\mathbf{x}}$, $(3+5\mathbf{x})^{7\mathbf{x}^{\mathbf{x}^2}}$, etc. Of course, the mathematical operations here are done pointwise. Now that we have the set $\mathcal{S}$, a relation is introduced on it. Let's define it. Let $f, g \in \mathcal{S}$. Write $f \prec g$ if and only if there exists $n_0 \in \mathbb{N}$ such that for all $n \geq n_0$, we have $f(n) &lt; g(n)$. This means that the function $g$ is eventually bigger than the function $f$; indeed, we say that $f$ is <em>majorized</em> or <em>dominated</em> by $g$. For example, $\mathbf{x} \prec \mathbf{x^2} \prec \mathbf{x^3}$ and so on. We will write $f \preceq g$ if $f \prec g$ or $f = g$ for each $f, g \in \mathcal{S}$. </p> <p align="justify"> Alright. We now have a set and a relation on it. What now? Well, by a result of Hardy's <a href="#hardy1924orders">[1]</a>, and also, independently, by both Richardson \cite{richardson1969solution} and Tarski, it follows that $(\mathcal{S}, \prec)$ is a linearly ordered set. Is that the best we can say about this ordering? Ehrenfeucht <a href="#ehrenfeucht1973polynomial">[2]</a> proved that this linear ordering is in fact a well-ordering (by the way, his paper is one of the shortest papers I've ever seen!). He used one of Kruskal's results (a Tree Theorem) <a href="#kruskal1960well">[3]</a> to prove that $(\mathcal{S}, \prec)$ is a well-ordering. Remarkable, isn't it? </p> <p align="justify"> Once we have a well-ordered set, we can ask what the order-type of that ordering is? That is, we can categorize, up to (order-)isomorphism, each well-ordered set in the class of all well-ordered sets. An isomorphism in the realm of order theory is a bijection from one ordered set to another preserving their corresponding orderings. This way we get an equivalence relation on the class of well-orderings. That means we get equivalence classes. So each equivalence class is assigned a mathematical object called an ordinal number, and we call this ordinal number the \textit{order type} of that well-ordering. Let's look at some examples. I will use the symbol $\leq$ for the usual ordering. </p> <ol> <li>$(\{0,1,2\}, \leq)$ has order type $3$. So does $(\{3,5,7\}, \leq)$.</li> <li>$(\mathbb{N}, \leq)$ has order type $\omega$. Note: $\omega$ is the first infinite ordinal number.</li> <li>$(\{0,1,2,3,\ldots,\omega\}, \leq)$ has order type $\omega + 1$.</li> </ol> <p align="justify"> Now that the stage has been set up, here's the problem! </p> <p> <strong>Problem 1</strong>: What is the order type of $(\mathcal{S}, \prec)$? </p> <p align="justify"> Skolem <a href="#skolem1956ordered">[4]</a> showed that the order type of the subset of $\mathcal{S}$ generated by $1$ and $\mathbf{x}$ using the operations addition, multiplication, and $g \mapsto \mathbf{x}^g$ is a well-ordered subset of type $\epsilon_0$. Here, $\epsilon_0$ is the least upper bound of the set of ordinals $\{\omega, \omega^{\omega}, \omega^{\omega^{\omega}}, \ldots\}$. Later, Levitz <a href="#levitz1975ordered">[5]</a> showed that $\mathcal{S}$ has a subset of order type $\epsilon_0$; namely the subset of $\mathcal{S}$ containing $1$, $f+g$, $fg$, $\mathbf{x}^f$, and $n^f$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}^&gt;$ whenever $f, g$ are in that subset. </p> <p align="justify"> The above findings suggest that the order-type of $(\mathcal{S},\prec)$ is pretty complicated! To make things a little simpler, let's look at a new problem. But before doing that, we'll fix some notation. Given $f \in \mathcal{S}$, let's write $\mathcal{S}(f)$ to denote the order type of the set $\{ g\in \mathcal{S} : g \prec f \}$. That is, instead of looking at the order-type of the entire set $\mathcal{S}$, we'll just look at the order-type of the segment determined by a given $f$ in $\mathcal{S}$. For example, if $f\in \mathcal{S}$ and $f\prec \mathbf{x}$, then we clearly see that $f$ is in $\mathbb{N}^&gt;$. So it follows that $\mathcal{S}(\mathbf{x})=\omega$. </p> <p> <strong>Problem 2</strong>: Given a fixed $f\in \mathcal{S}$, what is $\mathcal{S}(f)$? </p> <p align="justify"> I will now quickly introduce some terminology that we'll use in the future. </p> <p> <strong>Definition 1</strong>: Let $f\in\mathcal{S}$. <ol> <li>$f$ is an <em>additive prime</em> if $f$ cannot be written as $f=g+h$ with $g,h$ in $\mathcal{S}$.</li> <li>$f$ is a <em>multiplicative prime</em> if $f$ cannot be written as $f=gh$ where $g,h\neq 1$ are in $\mathcal{S}$.</li> <li>$f$ is an <em>exponential prime</em> if $f$ cannot be written as $f=g^h$ where $g,h\neq 1$ are in $\mathcal{S}$.</li> </ol> </p> <p align="justify"> I will end this post with the following two questions. </p> <p> <strong>Question 1</strong>: Determine all the functions $f\in \mathcal{S}$ that are primes according to all three definitions. </p> <p> <strong>Question 2</strong>: Show that each $f\in \mathcal{S}$ can be written as $f=p_1+\cdots+p_k$ with $p_1,\ldots,p_k$ additive primes in $\mathcal{S}$ and $p_k\preceq\cdots\preceq p_1$ for some $k\in \mathbb{N}^&gt;$. </p> <p align="justify"> I will answer these two questions in the next post (hope to see your answers in the comments!). There’s plenty of exciting content to come—think fascinating insights into ordinal numbers, nonstandard analysis, surreal numbers, and more. Stay tuned!
