    Abstract. Hoover and Keisler’s Probability Logic is a variant of first-order logic that
    substitutes the standard quantifiers $\forall$ and $\exists$ with probability quantifiers $(P x \geq r)$. The
    expression $(P x\geq r)\varphi(x)$ is interpreted to mean “the set $\{x: φ(x)\}$ has probability at least $r$.”
    We extend the Hoover-Keisler logic to accommodate capacities and introduce a new logic
    for capacity quantifiers. We establish a completeness theorem for our logic. Additionally,
    we conjecture that these theorems can be derived using nonstandard analysis as well.
