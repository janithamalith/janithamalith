I'm an aspiring mathematician with a passion for mathematical logic and its applications in mathematics and computer science. I'm actively seeking PhD opportunities in mathematical logic and computer science. I hold a Master's degree from the University of Hawai'i, where my advisor was Professor David Ross. My research focused on Model Theory and its applications, particularly Nonstandard Analysis and Probability logics. My master's project was titled "A Monadic Logic for Capacity Quantifiers." Prior to exploring probability logics, I worked on Skolem's problem of exponential functions.
